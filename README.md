# 2DVehiclePhysics
Simple 2D vehicle physics in Lua

This is a Lua port of SpaceJacks [car physics](https://github.com/spacejack/carphysics2d), itself an adaption of Marco Monster's [paper](https://asawicki.info/Mirror/Car%20Physics%20for%20Games/Car%20Physics%20for%20Games.html) on car physics.

It was written with the [Solar2D](https://solar2d.com/) engine in mind however could probably be used in other Lua based engines.
